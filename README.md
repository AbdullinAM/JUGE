junit tools contest infrastructure

# About

This is the source code for the contest infrastructure for junit testing tools.
The contest was initiated during the FITTEST European project no. 257574 (2010-2013)
and hence partly funded by the FP7 programme on ICT Software & Service Architectures and Infrastructures.

The [FITTEST](http://crest.cs.ucl.ac.uk/fittest/) project, which developed an integrated environment for the automated and continuous testing of Future Internet Applications, was coordinated by:<br />

  Tanja E. J. Vos (tvos@pros.upv.es)<br />
  Software Quality & Testing<br />
  Research Center on Software Production Methods ([PROS](http://www.pros.webs.upv.es/))<br />
  Department of Information Systems and Computation ([DSIC](http://www.upv.es/entidades/DSIC/index.html))<br />
  Universitat Politècnica de València ([UPV](http://www.upv.es/))<br />
  Camino de Vera s/n, 46022 Valencia (Spain)<br />

The contest infrastructure has been used in testing contests during yearly events from 2013 till 2017.
An upcoming event is expected for 2018.
